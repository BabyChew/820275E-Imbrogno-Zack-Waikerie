            <p>A Lotus Diagram is a brainstorming and organization tool. It helps define key concepts
                 or parts of a broader picture. The center of the diagram represents the main idea, 
                 with eight surrounding boxes representing additional concepts. 
                <br><br><b>Brainstorming can be a frustrating experience.</b><br><br>
                The following picture is an example picture of a Lotus Diagram.

        <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p>
            Upon selecting the Artificial Intelligence topic, I proceeded to narrow down my focus by choosing a specific question within this domain. Given that I had chosen Video Games as my sub-topic, I decided to explore the influence of AI on Video Games. Once I had defined this initial question, I further refined it to craft a more precise and detailed research inquiry.
       <br><br>
       In this Lotus Diagram, nine cells are dedicated to specific questions and aspects of the interaction between artificial intelligence (AI) and video games. The questions span from historical contexts to practical applications, with a central theme of "Video games." Each cell explores a unique facet of this relationship. The additional cell, "To what extent does artificial intelligence influence video games?" situated above the top right cell, acts as the overarching research question, connecting and guiding the investigation of all the other questions. This structured framework offers a comprehensive approach to understanding the role of AI in video games from multiple angles, making it an excellent tool for in-depth exploration and analysis.
