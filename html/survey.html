            <p>
            AI Familiarity: The respondents in this survey are quite familiar with AI, with 76.2% indicating they have some knowledge of AI, while 23.8% are not familiar. This suggests a majority of the respondents have some awareness of AI technology.
            </p>
            <h1>Question 2:</h1>
            <p>

            <h1>Question 3:</h1>
            <p>
            Frequency of NPC Encounters: Most respondents mentioned encountering NPCs "All the time," suggesting that NPCs are a common presence in the games they play. A few respondents reported encountering NPCs "Often enough," and only one mentioned not encountering them often. This indicates that NPCs are a significant part of their gaming experiences.
            </p>
            <h1>Question 4:</h1>
            <p>
            NPC Actions: The respondents listed various actions that NPCs perform in games. Most commonly mentioned are "Friendly NPCs" (those who interact with the player), followed by "Shopping NPCs" and "Quest NPCs." A significant number also mentioned "Evil NPCs," which are antagonistic characters in games.

            <p>
            Encountering Realistic AI: Half of the respondents (50%) reported encountering AI that they thought were real people in video games. This suggests that the AI in some games can mimic human behavior convincingly.
            </p>
