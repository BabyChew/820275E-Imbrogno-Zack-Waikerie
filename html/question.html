            <p> Everyone who completes a research project choses their own topic, this topic then becomes a question. 

                My question was "To what extent does artificial intelligence influence video games?" <br><br>

                The initial concept for my research was centred around Information Technology. I was uncertain about the specific IT topic to explore, so employing a lotus diagram focused on Information Technology facilitated my decision-making. Various potential topics surfaced, but one subject captured my interest. As I delved into this subject, I encountered a wealth of information, albeit somewhat overwhelming, necessitating refinement.

            <p>I contemplated various themes related to Artificial Intelligence, some of which proved fascinating, but one stood out above the rest. Conducting research on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and video games presented a modest yet intriguing scope. Consequently, I settled on the topic of Artificial Intelligence in video games, with the remaining task being the formulation of a research question.
                <br><br>
                The formulation of questions proved to be the most challenging aspect of this initial phase. However, one question held my attention and warranted further refinement: "What could be the impact of AI in FPS video games?" Following feedback from teachers, I modified the question to read, "To what extent does artificial intelligence influence video games?" This alteration was prompted by a teacher's suggestion to frame the question in the present tense, as research on future scenarios lacks factual basis or statistics. Although these were not the precise words, the guidance was invaluable."
